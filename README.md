# hue by Dypo
Hue is a simple plugin that lets players choose a persistant color that they can chat in, with the ability to change it
whenever they like, or disable it. Hue comes with an easy GUI to help players select their colors. Colors can also be
selected using commands. Hue also feautures sounds when selecting or disabling their color, and Action Bar support to
prevent chat spam.

At it's core, Hue is complete - it does what it was created to do. However, I still like to add/tweak minor features.
Please contact me if you have any suggestions, and I might implement them if I like them.

Hue is my first plugin. There might be simpler, more efficient ways to do what Hue does. I am still an amatuer,
so I am learning. I would love to hear suggestions or advice on how to improve Hue's code.

If you like it, please give it a good review! If not, tell me what I can do to improve it. :)
